# OpenLTM: Open Live Threat Map
This is a opensouce library for simulating attacks in real time, written in python. 
It parses the log.txt file containing location info of the attacker and then it projects them onto a world map in real time.
It is a client side tool for now.
This project is currently in its nebular form.
Feel free to use it as an API and contribute.
